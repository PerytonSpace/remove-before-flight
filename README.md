A StagWorks Project

# Remove Before Flight
The goal of the project is to create a reliable method for arming rocket flight computers with a mechanism that once removed will power and enable arming of rocket avionics.
The design will be subject to vibrations and shocks and high g-forces and so the design is required to be solid state with no moving parts that could activate during flight. 

## TPS22810
The design utilises the TPS22810 load switching IC. WHen the EN pin is HIGH the Vout is enabled, when LOW Vout is switched off.
